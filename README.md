# Dialogue System
This is a robust dialogue system project implemented in Unity and C# used to
parse a dialogue language that can be used in a game setting to display
branching dialogue paths to the player as dialogue lines and dialogue options.
This system also provides the user the ability to format lines if they want
using identified chunks of text which will then update the TextMeshProUGUI
object.
